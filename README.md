I am a **Native Mobile developer**, with some experience in Hybrid development with technologies such as Xamarin, Ionic, Flutter .... I also have knowledge and experience in server-side technologies such as PHP (Symfony, Laravel, Silex, Slim), Python (Django, Flask), NodeJS (Express, Sailsjs) and above all I love the **Spring ecosystem** and JavaEE or Jakarta EE ;)
